# Webinar on OERs in RDM
The University of British Columbia (UBC) Library Research Commons Team has been offering an extensive selection of workshops since late 2019 via the open-source GitHub platform. Using the same pedagogical approach shared with The Carpentries, all workshops are free, computationally reproducible, self-paced, and open for community reuse and adoption with appropriate licensing. This presentation will focus on explaining the thinking and background of selecting GitHub as an instructional delivery platform, outline the variety of workshop offerings, focus on research data management content, and share the lessons learned about teaching a catalogue of almost fifty workshops (<a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/all.html">https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/all.html</a>) within the open-source environment.

## Presenters: 
Ekatarina (Eka) GrguriÄ‡, Digital Scholarship Librarian, UBC Library
Eugene Barsky, Research Data Management Librarian, UBC Library
