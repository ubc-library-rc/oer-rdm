		 <li>New team, new approach</li>
		 <li>In January 2020</li>
	         <li>Working and learning together</li>
	       </ul>
        </section>

      <section>
	<h2>"Pre-GitHub"</h2>
		 <ul>
			<li>Many internal shared folders</li>
			<li>Non-portable & non-reproducible</li>
	                <li>Uncoordinated approaches</li>

	<h2>Proposed New Approach</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Collaborative, using freely available tools accessible outside of the university</li>
			<li>Git, GitHub, Github Pages & Reveal.js </li>
	                <li>Presentations through Github Pages</li>

            <h2>Why GitHub?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Existing experience on the team with Git and Github</li>
                <li>Already in use by members of the team for similar cases (GIS workshops)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This included workshop content in repo and Reveal.js slides via GH Pages</li>

                  <li>Philosophical desire to lower barriers to access and remixing</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Not a UBC specific platform / approach</li>
                      <li>Content requires only a browser window to access and is downlodable for bad connections</li>

      <h2>Sustainability</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Text-based approach easy to move, remix, repurpose</li>
          <li>Better ownership, collaboration, and maintenance workflows with growth in size of unit</li>

          <h5>Setup</h5>
          <ul style="font-size: 0.8em">
            <li>GitHub account for each contributor</li>
            <li>GitHub <em>organization</em> for Research Commons</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The requirements for our workflow are relatively simple. GitHub is the only platform that's a must. Each person who will contriubute to or manage the content should have their own GitHub account.</p>
            <p>We gather the individual accounts under a GitHub organization, which makes it relatively easy to add or revoke rights as collaborators come and go. All our repositories are "owned" by the organization, not by individual acconts.</p>

            <li>reveal.js html files</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>he workshop source material is written in Markdown. Many workshop sites include the presentation slides - these can be added to the repository in any format, but doing them in reveal.js provides more flexibility for presenting them within the workshop site.</p>

        <div class="fragment" style="width: 28%; padding: 2%; text-align: left; position: relative; float: left">

            <p>The skills required for authoring content are familiarity with Markdown and GitHub. That's a relatively low barrier but those skills aren't universal and getting the whole team comfortable with the tools can take some work.
            In additon to the basic authoring skills, someone on the team will need to understand how Jekyll works, but that can be just one person to handle the theme and configuration options.</p>

          # Introduction to Docker

          This workshop is meant to introduce you to the set of virtualization
          tools referred to as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which allow
          you to use, create, and share container images.

          [Containers](https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html)
          create small reproducible computing workspaces on your computer, to
          which you can ascribe specific libraries and constraints to
          replicate specific environments.

          ## Workshop Objectives

          We'll first discuss broader concepts from the computing virtualization
          space, disambiguate the many interrelated components of the
          Docker ecosystem, and explore some use cases demonstrating the
          value of containers in both tech and academia.

          Then we'll walk through an overview of install pathways for different
          operating systems and intended uses, touching on some general
          troubleshooting points and the cognitive competencies cultivated
          by dev ops tools like these.

            <p>In the "content" folder are multiple markdown files; each becomes its own page on the workshop site. This folder organization is useful but not required: the markdown files can be anywhere in the repository. How they're presented on the site is governed by a yaml header in each file, not by the structure of the repository.</p>
            <p>Those familiar with Jekyll will notice that there aren't many Jekyll-related files in this repo.</p>

          <p>That's because in our workflow the Jekyll theme lives in a separate repository. This improves consistency across our workshop sites and makes updates and upgrades easier.</p>
          <p>The Jekyll theme we use in the Research Commons is based on the Just the Docs theme with some local changes to the layout and css files. This theme-repository is called upon whenever one of the workshop sites is built (whether by GitHub pages or in a local Jekyll environment).</p>

## RDM Coming in...
- Since 2013 we have experimented with a variety of teaching platforms
- Google Slides, OSF, PPT, and more...
- Nothing really worked
<img src="media/osf2.jpeg" />
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Changing the format
- Gut feeling - too much content
- 60-90 minutes of RDM is hard to absorb, each topic gets swallowed by the next
- Needed drastic redesign of content
- Needed smaller chunks, that build on top of another but also can be independent and flexible to be served to a variety of researchers and/or students
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Enter Data Bites
- Series of 30 minutes workshops
    - 10 minutes of content
    - 10 minutes of exercises
    - 10 minutes of questions
- Over the lunch hour, in-person or Zoom
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Format
- Research Commons Github template
- Each workshop features two participatory exercises on Padlet
- A lot of hands-on
- Supplemented by a one-page PDF as a lesson-to-go
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Example - File Naming workshop
- Introduce the principles
- Do a little exercise
- Reflect and ask questions
- See live - [File Naming](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/rdm/content/01_file_naming.html)
</script>

## RDM Offerings
- Offered once a week by an RDM GAA (librarian always attending)
- Overall, each workshop is offered three times each term
- Attendance steady at around 10-15 students and researchers
- Many staff are attending - lab managers, grant facilitators, research coordinators...
- Feedback - 96 percent satisfaction
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## RDM Offerings
- Some classes want to combine these modules into one workshop
    - MEDI 503
    - Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program
    - Mechanical Engineering 497
    - Brain Science - NRSC510
- All  grad level
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Assessment
- 45 workshops offered for more than 800 attendees last school year (September 2023-August 2024)
- Survey sent two hours after the workshop
- Data collated monthly
- High satisfaction overall (96 percent)
- Some tweaks suggested and some implemented
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Assessment
- Yearly review of content in the summer
- New GAA = opportunity to update and have fresh eyes
- Asked for community feedback
- Some professors reviewing and sometimes suggesting content
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Lessons learned
- GAAs need training and support to offer RDM workshops
    - Six weeks hands-on training
- Content needs to be fresh, people look at date stamps
- Only around half of attendees engage with exercises
- One-page guides are useful take-away format
    - need to be updated yearly
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
## Near Future
- Markdown workshops series
- Hoping for community feedback and suggestions for new content
